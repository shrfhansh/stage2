## 1.0 Problem Statement 

Over 50% of population are dependent on agriculture. The major source of earnings, it also contributes to our survival by supplying meals. Today's farmers, however, confront a variety of challenges in maintaining their crops, including subpar irrigation, water management and extensive pesticide use.


## 2.0 System Architecture

To overcome this problem, we adopted an agriculture monitoring system using IoT.  This system integrates three types of sensors: pH level sensor, temperature sensor and moisture sensors and send data to dashboard where user can get the current and average reading.
